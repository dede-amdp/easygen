        <h1>❓ What is DocGen?</h1><br>
        DocGen is a automatic generation tool that extracts the comments from the code files you upload and generates
        documentation automatically!
        <h1>❓ How do I use DocGen?</h1><br>
        It's simple! Just upload the files that contain the code and a documentation file will be automatically
        generated containing the documentation of all the uploaded files.
        <h1>⚙️ Instructions</h1><br>
        To be able to extract the comments from a file, DocGen needs 2 things:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Comment blocks</b>: these comment blocks/ multiline blocks need to contain the info that DocGen will
                use;
            </li>
            <li><b>Fields</b>: fields are needed to recognize different parts of the information.</li>
        </ul>
        All the fields start with a `@` symbol and then are followed by the information you want to write, for
        example<br>
        @name method_name
        @brief this is an example of what you can do
        @note this is just an example and it is possible to add any other user defined fields
        @variables
        - a: something
        - b: something else
        the only required fields are `@name` which contains the name of the
        method that you are describing (or of whatever part of the code is going to be described) and `@brief` which
        just contains a summary of the method that will is currently being described.<br>
        Another special field is `@note` which can be used freely to add any information is needed.<br>
        Lastly, all the other fields (that you can define freely) will be inserted inside a table.<br>
        <h1>✨ What about the final result?</h1>
        The output file is a markdown file, so within each field it is possible to use both markdown ad HTML notation to
        customize anything about the documentation.<br>
        The supported files for now are <substitute id="supported"></substitute> but others may be added in the future.
