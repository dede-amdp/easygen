        <h1>‚ùì What is EasyGen?</h1><br>
        EasyGen is a automatic generation tool that extracts the comments from the code files you upload and generates
        documentation automatically!
        <h1>‚ùì How do I use EasyGen?</h1><br>
        It's simple! Just upload the files that contain the code and a documentation file will be automatically
        generated containing the documentation of all the uploaded files.
        <h1>‚öôÔ∏è Instructions</h1><br>
        To be able to extract the comments from a file, EasyGen needs 2 things:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Comment blocks</b>: these comment blocks/ multiline blocks need to contain the info that EasyGen will
                use;
            </li>
            <li><b>Fields</b>: fields are needed to recognize different parts of the information.</li>
        </ul>
        All the fields are contained between two starting and ending symbols that define a section: `#@` to show where
        the section starts and `@#` to show where it ends. Please be careful to always have a space between the
        multiline comments symbols of the programming language you are using and the starting and ending symbols used to
        define the documentation section: this will ensure that the symbols will be recognized and not confused with
        another symbol fusion of the comment symbol and the section one.<br>
        Each section is made of fields, defined by using a tag: each tag starts with a `@` symbol and a field name (with
        no spaces) ending with `:`, followed by the information you want to write, for
        example:<br><br>
        <div class="code"><code>@name: method_name<br>
        @brief :this is an example of what you can do<br>
        @notes: this is just an example and it is possible to add any other user defined fields<br>
        @inputs:<br>
        - a: something<br>
        - b: something else</code></div><br><br>
        There are some special fields that will be formatted in specific ways, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>name: used to state the name of the section that is being defined, like the name of a method, a class,
                etc...;</li>
            <li>brief: used for a summary of what the section described does;</li>
            <li>notes: used to write more detailed information;</li>
            <li>inputs: used to describe the inputs to a function;</li>
            <li>outputs: used to describe the output values;</li>
        </ul>
        other tags can be created by the user by simply writing a custom tag (REMEMBER: don't use spaces), the contents
        of these field will be added to a table.<br>
        <h1>üë®‚Äçüíª Code Snippets!</h1>
        Code snippets can be added by using the `#@codestart@#` and `#@codeend@#` fields (always within a multiline
        comment block): the `#@codestart@#` has to be put before the code section that you want to include, the
        `#@codeend@#`
        field has to be put at the end of the code section. Within these sections, comments can be inserted as normal to
        explain the behaviour of the code. As for the `#@` and `@#` symbols, please ensure that the code snippets
        symbols are separated from the comment block symbols with at least a space, otherwise they will not be
        recognized correctly.
        There can be multiple code snippets and they will be considered as part of the comment block
        that precedes them.<br>
        This is an example of how to use it:<br><br>
        <div class="code"><code>
            /* #@codestart@# */<br>
            //this is the code that will be inserted<br>
            for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++){<br>
                console.log("<3\n");<br>
            }<br>
            /* #@codeend@# */<br>
        </code>
        </div>
        <h1>‚ú® What about the final result?</h1>
        The output file is a markdown file, so within each field it is possible to use both markdown ad HTML notation to
        customize anything about the documentation.<br>
        The supported files for now are <substitute id="supported"></substitute> but others may be added in the future.
