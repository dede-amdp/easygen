        <h1>‚ùì What is EasyGen?</h1><br>
        EasyGen is a automatic generation tool that extracts the comments from the code files you upload and generates
        documentation automatically!
        <h1>‚ùì How do I use EasyGen?</h1><br>
        It's simple! Just upload the files that contain the code and a documentation file will be automatically
        generated containing the documentation of all the uploaded files.
        <h1>‚öôÔ∏è Instructions</h1><br>
        To be able to extract the comments from a file, EasyGen needs 2 things:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Comment blocks</b>: these comment blocks/ multiline blocks need to contain the info that EasyGen will
                use;
            </li>
            <li><b>Fields</b>: fields are needed to recognize different parts of the information.</li>
        </ul>
        All the fields start with a `@` symbol and a field name, followed by the information you want to write, for
        example<br><br>
        <div class="code"><code>@name method_name<br>
        @brief this is an example of what you can do<br>
        @note this is just an example and it is possible to add any other user defined fields<br>
        @variables<br>
        - a: something<br>
        - b: something else</code></div><br><br>
        the only required fields is the `@name` field which contains the name of the
        method that you are describing (or of whatever part of the code is going to be described).<br>
        Other special fields are `@brief` that contains a summary of what is described and `@note` which can be used
        freely
        to add any information is needed.<br>
        Lastly, all the other fields (that you can define freely) will be inserted inside a table.<br>
        <h1>üë®‚Äçüíª Code Snippets!</h1>
        Code snippets can be added by using the `@codestart` and `@codeend` fields (always between multiline comment
        blocks): the `@codestart`, followed by the
        name of the code snippet, has to be put before the code section that you want to include, the `@codeend` field
        has to be put at the end of the code section. Within these sections, comments can be inserted as normal to
        explain the function of the code.
        There can be multiple code snippets (with different names) and they will considered as part of the comment block
        that precedes them.<br>
        This is an example of how to use it:<br><br>
        <div class="code"><code>
            /*@codestart name1*/<br>
            //this is the code that will be inserted<br>
            for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++){<br>
                console.log("<3\n");<br>
            }<br>
            /*@codeend*/<br>
        </code>
        </div>
        <h1>‚ú® What about the final result?</h1>
        The output file is a markdown file, so within each field it is possible to use both markdown ad HTML notation to
        customize anything about the documentation.<br>
        The supported files for now are <substitute id="supported"></substitute> but others may be added in the future.
